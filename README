== Usage ==

See cortex_test.c for example code.  cortex_test.c reads in a cortex alignment
file or variant bubble calls, parses then and prints them back out.  

Please contact me with questions, requests and bug reports

For perl code for handling cortex data, please see:

== Build ==

In order to build the test code, cortex.h needs to be able to find string_buffer.h
string_buffer is a separate project, which provides a useful string buffer object
for use in C.  You're welcome to use it in your own projects too, you may find
it useful!  It uses the same license as this project (GPLv3).  

string_buffer can be found here: http://github.com/noporpoise/StringBuffer

To build the test code:

1) Change directory into the cortex directory (the one with this README in it!)
$ cd cortex

2) Create a directory called 'libs'
$ mkdir libs

3) download the string_buffer directory (from: http://github.com/noporpoise/StringBuffer)
   into the libs directory

4) Edit the first line of Makefile to read:
   LIBS_PATH=./libs
   instead of:
   LIBS_PATH=../

5) Then type make!

$ make
$ ./cortex_test

In order to use CortexLib in your own code:

1) Download string_buffer and CortexLib
2) place at the top of your code:

#include "cortex.h"

3) compile with gcc options:
  -lz -I path/to/string_buffer/ -I path/to/cortex/

  and the files:

  path/to/cortex/cortex.c path/to/string_buffer/string_buffer.c
